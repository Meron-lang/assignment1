   <h1> OUR AMAZING STAFF</h1>
All staff members are located in Sudan, and all are themselves refugees. 
They bring the expertise that they developed in prior work experience in Eritrea, 
and we equip them with the materials to be effective in teaching and their other roles in supporting our students.




<h1>Global Team</h1>
We are a group of volunteers located in the United States—many of us ourselves former refugees—who 
are committed to improving the lives of immigrants through education and vocational programs. 
We hope that the training opportunities that we provide will enable immigrants to obtain better employment 
and provide better lives for themselves and their families in their future adopted countries.
